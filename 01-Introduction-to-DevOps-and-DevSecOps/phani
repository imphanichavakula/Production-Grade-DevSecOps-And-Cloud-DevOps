Traditional SDLC: Gone through multiple phases
Requirement gathering -> Design -> implementation -> testing -> deployment -> Maintainence
Limitations:
1) Slow delivery
2) lack of flexibility
3) late testing
4) Misscommunication or Communication gaps and delays

DEVOPS = Development + Operations
Advantages:
1) Faster delivery or release cycles
2) Automations of builds,testing and deployment
3) Breakes the gap between dev and ops team

DevSecOps = Development + Security + Operations
integrate security into the devops practice.(At every stage of the pipeline)
Finding risks as eraly as possible (Vulnerabilities are caught early, reducing risks and costs.)
Security is nolonger an after thought at the end

Shift-Left Security: Move security towards the earlier phase of development.
Benifit: Faster fixes, lower costs and secured application protection.
