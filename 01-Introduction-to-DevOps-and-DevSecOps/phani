Task 1 – DevOps, DevSecOps & Why They Exist

Traditional SDLC: Gone through multiple phases
Requirement gathering -> Design -> implementation -> testing -> deployment -> Maintainence
Limitations:
1) Slow delivery
2) lack of flexibility
3) late testing
4) Misscommunication or Communication gaps and delays

DEVOPS = Development + Operations
Advantages:
1) Faster delivery or release cycles
2) Automations of builds,testing and deployment
3) Breakes the gap between dev and ops team

DevSecOps = Development + Security + Operations
integrate security into the devops practice.(At every stage of the pipeline)
Finding risks as eraly as possible (Vulnerabilities are caught early, reducing risks and costs.)
Security is nolonger an after thought at the end

Shift-Left Security: Move security towards the earlier phase of development.
Benifit: Faster fixes, lower costs and secured application protection.

Task 2 – How DevOps Works in Real Companies

1. High-Level DevOps Workflow
- Code Commit:
- Developers write code and push it to a shared repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- Version control ensures collaboration and history tracking.
- Build : The code is compiled and packaged automatically using build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle, Jenkins).
- Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines trigger builds on every commit.
- Testing: Automated tests (unit, integration, regression) run to validate functionality.
- Tools: JUnit, Selenium, pytest.
- Security Scanning :  Code and dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities.
- Tools: SonarQube, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check.
- Artifact Creation : Once validated, the build produces deployable artifacts (e.g., Docker images, JAR/WAR files).
- Stored in artifact repositories like Nexus or Artifactory.
- Deployment : Artifacts are deployed to staging or production environments.
- Tools: Kubernetes, Helm, Ansible, Terraform.
- Monitoring : Applications and infrastructure are continuously monitored for performance, errors, and security.
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog.

2. DevOps Team Roles
- > DevOps Engineer
- Designs CI/CD pipelines.
- Automates deployments and infrastructure.
- Bridges dev and ops teams.
-----------------------------------------------
- > Security Engineer
- Integrates security tools into pipelines.
- Ensures compliance and vulnerability management.
- Promotes “shift-left” security practices.
-------------------------------------------------

- > Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
- Focuses on system reliability, uptime, and scalability.
- Implements monitoring, alerting, and incident response.
- Balances innovation with stability.
---------------------------------------------------------

3. Day-to-Day DevOps Activities
- Managing CI/CD pipelines.
- Automating infrastructure with IaC (Infrastructure as Code).
- Running automated tests and scans.
- Deploying updates frequently.
- Monitoring systems and responding to incidents.
- Collaborating across dev, ops, and security teams.

4. Why Deployment Strategies Matter
- Deployment strategies reduce downtime and risk.
- They allow testing new versions in production safely.
- They ensure smooth user experience during updates.

5. Example Deployment Strategy: Blue-Green Deployment
- Concept: Two environments — Blue (current live) and Green (new version).
- Process:
- Deploy new version to Green.
- Test Green environment thoroughly.
- Switch traffic from Blue to Green once stable.
- Benefit: Zero downtime, easy rollback if issues occur.
